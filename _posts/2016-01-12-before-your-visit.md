Bring all your medications with you and confirm with us that we did receive your previous workup to avoid any delay or unnecessary repetition of a previous workup that was done.

Make sure you have filled in the appropriate forms accurately. It may seem difficult, but this is done just once and could be updated anytime. Please provide us with your phone number and alternate phone number as well as your email address and pharmacy information since having those in our records helps us serve you better.
